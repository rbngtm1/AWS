#### EFS
  * Note EBS can only be connected to one machine but EFS can be connected to multiple machine. 
  * You use EFS to copy some data to other servers
  * Go to EFS and create file system 
  * create a NFS inbound rule for port 2049 on EFS security group
  * you may follow up the amazon ec2 mount instructions (click link in file system UI) 
  * in opt/ mount -t nfs fs-2342342.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /opt/folder   (efs for linux, nfs for rhel and others)(DNS name is in UI)
  * run df -h  --you can see the file system attached
  * You must have same folder and run above 2 command on both machine. 
  * Whatever file you make on one machine under that folder will be reflected to another. 
  * SAN(Storage array network) --is like EBS
  * NAS(network attached storage) --is like EFS  (nfs is protocol)
  * now when you do reboot, you need to again mount it. But we have solution below.
  * vi /etc/fstab
  * on last line add one more 0, add below line just below it
  * fs-2342342.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /opt/folder       nfs       defaults       0 0  (change efs, nfs per machine)
  * 0 0 talks about backups and systemchecks 
  
  
#### EBS
  * Create a volume with 2 GB for testing purpose and attach to a instance. Note they should be in same AZ
  * lsblk --listblockstorage
  * for new block storage to attach in a instance
  * mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf --only if it is new volume, run this command for formating
  * mount /dev/xvdf /opt/folder1
  * have folder1 and some files in it. 
  * vim /etc/fstab (do 5 steps below command , just below command is just an option)
  * /dev/xvdf /opt/folder1           xfs              defaults       0 0
  * You can do above thing with UUID, aws suggests doing so. 
  * blkid 
  * vim /etc/fstab
  * UUID="copy id of /dev/xvdf" /opt/folder1          xfs       defaults       0 0
  * umount /opt/folder1   ==for unmounting 
  * now you can detach volume and attach to another machine. data will come up 
  * file -s /dev/xvdf ==to see filesystem data
  * mount -t  xfs /dev/xvdf /var/folder1
  * you have the file now.
